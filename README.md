# Leveraging ChatGPT, Gemini, and Hugging Face to develop virtual agents capable of responding to surveys

## Summary
In this mini-course, participants will learn how to create virtual personas using artificial intelligence platforms such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Hugging Face. The course combines theoretical foundations of LLMs (Large Language Models) with hands-on activities through interactive exercises. We begin with a general introduction to LLMs, followed by an explanation of the concept of prompt engineering and its application in real-world scenarios. In the second part of the course, agents will be configured to generate virtual data based on observable phenomena. The course will conclude with an analysis of the bias (error) between the data generated by the models and the empirically observed values

**Agenda**

1. Introduction to LLMs (Large Language Models – ChatGPT, Gemini and Hugging Face).
2. Create and interact with virtual agents using LLMs.
3. Generate and analyze knowledge about a population using LLMs.
4. Understand how to use LLMs for data simulation.
5. Calculate bias measures between empirically observed data and data generated by virtual agents.
6. Practical exercises.  

**Requirements**
* Laptop/computer with internet access 
* Account on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/)
* Account on ChatGPT (https://chatgpt.com)
* Google account (Google Colab and Gemini)
* Basic knowledge of Python
