# Virtual Personas: A Hands-on Journey into Large Language Models

## Introduction

This interactive workshop explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) create and maintain virtual personas. Participants will gain both theoretical understanding and practical experience through hands-on exercises. The workshop progresses through multiple levels: from basic prompting to complex population-level persona engineering, examining the underlying mechanisms of LLMs. Through a combination of theory and practice, participants will explore the architecture and behavior of these models while working with concrete examples

**Workshop Overview (1 hour)**

1. Introduction & Setup (5 minutes) 
2. Individual Prompting (15 minutes) 
3. Population-Level Prompting (20 minutes) 
4. Repeated Sampling (15 minutes) 
5. Q&A (5 minutes)

**Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this workshop, participants will: -
* Create and interact with individual synthetic personas using LLMs 
* Generate and analyze population-level insights 
* Understand how to use LLMs for survey simulation 
* Gain hands-on experience with LLM APIs

**Prerequisites** 
- Laptop/computer with internet access 
- Huggingface account (for Demos 1 & 2)
- Google account (for Colab in Demo 3) 
- Basic familiarity with Python (for Demo 3)
