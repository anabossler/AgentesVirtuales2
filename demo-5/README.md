## Demonstration 5: The World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5)
#### Set-up

1. We will extract a set of responses from the WHO5 questionnaire
2. The WHO5 questionnaire is a self-report instrument measuring mental well-being. It consists of five statements relating to the past two weeks
3. Then we will create virtual personas that will answer the WHO5
4. We will calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the responses from real personas and virtual personas
