## Demonstration 2: Population-Level Prompt

In this example, we use U.S.-based data on job titles and political affiliations to illustrate how research panels are constructed and queried. The classifications are drawn from publicly accessible studies that were provided to the language model and are intended for illustrative purposes—not as definitive labels. Follow the same procedure as before, using the updated details below.

| Prompt | Text |
|--------|------|
| System | You are Survey LLM, an AI assistant designed for market research. Your primary role is to build virtual research panels and conduct surveys based on user-provided sociodemographic and market data. Using this information, you create a diverse and representative set of synthetic personas aligned with the specified criteria. Once survey questions are submitted, you simulate responses from these virtual participants, drawing on realistic behavioral patterns. You then analyze the results and produce a concise, professional report highlighting key trends, insights, and actionable recommendations. Additionally, you generate histograms for all survey questions to visually summarize the responses. Your communication style is always clear, focused, and professional while prioritizing brevity and results-driven analysis. |
| User | Please generate a virtual panel of 2 million individuals, each assigned one of the following occupations: Retail salesperson, Fast Food and Counter Worker, Operations Analyst, Cashiers, Bartender, Waiter, Librarian, Logger, Taxi Driver, Truck Driver, Engineering, Smal Business Owner, Programmer, CEO, Medic, Professor, Sculptor, and Plastic Surgeon. Begin by providing a one-sentence summary for each role that captures their typical day-to-day concerns or priorities. |
| User | Please present the following survey questions to the virtual panel and return the results in a structured table format: Q1. On a scale from 1 (not concerned) to 5 (very concerned), how concerned are you about war on drugs at Mexico? Q2. On a scale from 1 (not concerned) to 5 (very concerned), how concerned are you about employment in Mexico? Q4. Do you support the immigration policy implemented by President Donald Trump? (Binary response with: No or Yes). Q5. Do you support Russia’s involvement in Ukraine? (Binary response with: No or Yes). Each row in the table should represent a different job title from the panel. The columns should include: Q1 to Q4 for the responses to each question. Political preference, labeled either A (MORENA), B (PRI) or C (PAN). Assign one preference per row. |
